The error log indicates a repeated issue with generating an emailable report using Allure Docker Service. The process involves generating a default report for a project with ID "default" using Allure version 2.27.0. However, attempts to call the Allure Docker Service at `http://localhost:5050/allure-docker-service/emailable-report/render?project_id=default` fail repeatedly. Each call is retried every 2 seconds, but after 7 attempts, a timeout occurs. This sequence of retries and timeouts is repeated twice in the log.
